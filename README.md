expanded on idea with python on rocket registry, weantedtyo use psql but due to limited timeand complexsity was unable to fully get it working. However there were commands inputed that connected to a psql database and so if chose for example 1=atlas it would atalas to the databse, very hard coded which was not primary goal. Wanted to have it where user could input a specfic type of engine for example vs a harded exact engine already there.
